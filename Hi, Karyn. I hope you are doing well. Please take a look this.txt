Hi Karyn, I hope you’re doing well.

I have a small favor to ask. As you may know, last Friday my Gannett Microsoft account was locked, and I lost access to the GUP GitHub project and other related tools. Unfortunately, the issue hasn’t been resolved yet, and I’m still not sure of the exact cause.

I’ve tried reaching out to Andy through Jeff (he’s a mutual contact who originally introduced me to Andy), but I haven’t been able to get direct confirmation so far. If you don’t mind, could you please share Andy’s email address so I can contact him directly to better understand the issue and help get it resolved?

I’d really appreciate your help and consideration.

Thank you,
Lucas
